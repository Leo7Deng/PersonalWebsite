	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h4>
		I'm a student interested in expanding my knowledge of computer science and software engineering. First finding interest in deep learning, I involved myself with research and startups. Wanting to test my skills, I have also participated in competitive coding. Currently, I am learning to develop front and back end we applications as well as learning new languages like C and Rust.
	</h4>
	<h4>Outside of coding, you'll find me in the gym, trying all kinds of food, and travelling the world.</h4>
