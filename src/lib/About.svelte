	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h4>
		I'm a student interested in learning many skills in software development, aiming to become a
		more well rounded engineer. As a generalist, I always thought I would never master a skill, but
		now I have learned to lean into my strengths of being a fast learner to succeed in any field.
	</h4>
	<h4>
		I started my journey into computer science with machine learning, hoping to solve major issues
		in the healthcare industry. As I got involved with research, I realized the many blind spots I
		had in coding in general. I tried my skill in competitive coding where I further learned I knew
		nothing about web development. After developing frontend and backend web projects, I realized
		the impossible task of learning everything about computer science. This website is to share that
		impossible journey.
	</h4>
	<h4>
		Outside of learning, I still have many responsibilities to my life in bodybuilding, trying all
		kinds of food, and travelling the world.
