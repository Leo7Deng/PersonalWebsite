		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<h4>
			I'm a student interested in expanding my knowledge of computer science and software
			engineering. First finding interest in deep learning, I involved myself with research and
			startups. Wanting to test my skills, I have also participated in competitive coding.
			Currently, I am learning to develop front and back end we applications as well as learning new
			languages like C and Rust.
		</h4>
		<h4>
			Outside of coding, you'll find me in the gym, trying all kinds of food, and travelling the
			world.
